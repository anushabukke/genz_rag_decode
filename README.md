### Decode GenZ slang and chat abbreviations with AI ⚡

**Decode GenZ AI** is an intelligent Chrome Extension that helps you instantly understand modern slang, abbreviations, and chat terms.  
Powered by **Google Gemini** and **Qdrant Vector Search**, it uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to give *context-aware, AI-generated meanings and examples* — not just static definitions.

Developed “GenZ Decode,” an AI-powered slang decoder that integrates Google Gemini and Qdrant to interpret and explain Gen Z abbreviations using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context-aware responses.

Implemented a full-stack architecture with vector embeddings, semantic search, and real-time AI text generation, delivering sleek UI and intelligent slang explanations via a Chrome extension.

🚀 Skills Demonstrated

✅ RAG Pipeline – using semantic retrieval before AI generation.
✅ Full Stack Development – frontend, backend, and API handling.
✅ Vector Databases – initializing collections, upserting points, and querying similarity.
✅ Asynchronous JavaScript – handling API calls and JSON responses.
✅ Prompt Engineering – crafting dynamic context-aware prompts.
✅ Frontend Design – building a modern, responsive UI with UX principles.
✅ Error Handling & Data Validation – clean server-side logic.
✅ AI Integration – connecting Gemini for embeddings and text generation.
✅ API Architecture – modular service-based structure (genai.js, slang.js, qdrant.js).
